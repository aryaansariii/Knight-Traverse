# Knight's Tour A* Algorithm

A Python program that finds the best possible way for the knight to reach the goal position (8,8) on the chessboard using the A* algorithm. Users can input the number of blocks and their positions to create obstacles for the knight.

## Introduction

The Knight's Tour A* Algorithm program aims to determine the optimal sequence of moves for a knight on a chessboard to reach the goal position (8,8). The A* algorithm is employed to efficiently explore possible paths while avoiding user-defined blocks.

### Input
The program prompts the user to enter the number of blocks and their positions on the chessboard.
Blocks cannot be placed at positions (1, 1) or (8, 8) to ensure a valid solution.
